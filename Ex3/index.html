            <p>Who am I? My name is Antonette Gichohu, a computer science major here at the University of Kansas. I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya and moved to Overland Park
                    Kansas when I was 11 years old. I am now 19 years old, and I am having a lot of fun here. I am very tall, and I really like cats. Those may seem like seemingly
                    independent events, but if you were tall you would know that they are not.
